title: Learning Spatio-Temporal Specifications for Dynamical Systems
abstract: Learning dynamical systems properties from data provides valuable insights
  that help us understand such systems and mitigate undesired outcomes. We propose
  a framework for learning spatio-temporal (ST) properties as formal logic specifications
  from data. We introduce Support Vector Machine-Signal Temporal Logic (SVM-STL),
  an extension of Signal Temporal Logic (STL), capable of specifying spatial and temporal
  properties of a wide range of systems exhibiting time-varying spatial patterns.
  Our framework utilizes machine learning techniques to learn SVM-STL specifications
  from system executions given by sequences of spatial patterns. We present methods
  to deal with both labeled and unlabeled data. In addition, given system requirements
  in the form of SVM-STL specifications, we provide an approach for parameter synthesis
  to find parameters that maximize the satisfaction of such specifications. Our learning
  framework and parameter synthesis approach are showcased in an example of a reaction-diffusion
  system.
